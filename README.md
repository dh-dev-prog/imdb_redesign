# imdb_redesign
April 2017 - Created a 'imdb redesign' website from a mock-up. This one was made by Roy Soetantio. More about those redesigns here: http://www.vandelaydesign.com/redesign-concepts-for-imdb/.

The main page is "index.html". Open this page to navigate on the website. 
Only the movies present in the banner/slider have their own page.

Please check the iphone branch for an iphone presentation and the responsive branch to get the responsive version (until 768px).
